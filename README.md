Hey, this is a README and if you are on this code, it's a type of dark tales site. 

To address the problem you may have in case you miss out on tales because you downloaded this locally (I did not do URLs), if it ever gets popular, you might stay updated
on some kind of platform that I don't know yet, I have no idea if this will get popular, so stay updated, stay frosty (lol).

Allow me to address what I say. Most if not all of the dark tales are generated by ChatGPT using my ideas. So, this is mostly idea exploring and trying to make power-scaling an entity actually dark and disturbing. If you don't like AI-made stories from prompts of my ideas, then yeah, I don't blame you.
